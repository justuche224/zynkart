Choosing the right payment gateway can make or break your online store. In Nigeria, two names dominate the conversation: Paystack and Flutterwave. Both are excellent options, but which one is right for your specific situation?

Let's break down the honest differences to help you decide.

## The Quick Background

Paystack was founded in 2016 and acquired by Stripe in 2020. It's become the go-to payment solution for many Nigerian businesses, known for its developer-friendly approach and clean, simple interface.

Flutterwave, also founded in 2016, has grown into a pan-African payment giant. It offers extensive payment options and serves businesses across multiple African countries, making it particularly attractive for sellers thinking about regional expansion.

## Comparing Transaction Fees

This is usually the first question everyone asks: how much will it cost me?

For Paystack, local card transactions cost 1.5% plus N100. International cards are charged at 3.9% plus N100. Bank transfers are free under N10,000, then just N10 per transfer. All fees are capped at N2,000 per transaction.

Flutterwave charges 1.4% for local cards, 3.8% for international cards, and 1.4% for bank transfers, also capped at N2,000 per transaction.

Looking purely at percentages, Flutterwave is slightly cheaper. However, Paystack's bank transfer pricing is often better for low-value transactions. Depending on your average order value and how customers prefer to pay, either could work out more economical.

## Payment Methods

Both gateways support the essentials: Visa, Mastercard, and Verve cards, plus bank transfers, USSD, mobile money, and QR codes.

Where Flutterwave pulls ahead is in offering additional options like Barter (Flutterwave's own wallet), Mpesa for East African customers, and both Google Pay and Apple Pay. If you're planning to sell across Africa or want maximum payment flexibility, Flutterwave offers more choices.

Paystack is working on Apple Pay support, but if you specifically need those extra payment methods today, Flutterwave has the edge.

## Dashboard Experience

Paystack's dashboard is clean and minimalist. Everything is easy to find, transactions update in real time, and exporting reports is straightforward. Most people can figure it out within minutes.

Flutterwave's dashboard has more features, which means more complexity. There's more data available and powerful filtering options, but it can feel overwhelming at first. Power users tend to appreciate the additional capabilities once they learn the interface.

If simplicity matters most to you, Paystack wins. If you want maximum control and don't mind a learning curve, Flutterwave delivers.

## How Fast You Get Paid

This matters a lot for cash flow. Paystack offers next-day settlement for most accounts, with same-day options available for high-volume merchants. Automatic settlements are available, and you can also trigger manual withdrawals.

Flutterwave settlements typically take 24 to 72 hours. You can request faster settlement, but it depends on your verification level and account history.

For most sellers, Paystack gets money into your account faster by default.

## Customer Support

When something goes wrong with a payment, you need help fast.

Paystack offers email support, a detailed help center, active Twitter presence through @PaystackHelpNG, and phone support for business accounts. Response times are generally quick.

Flutterwave provides email support, extensive documentation, Twitter support through @theaboraborar, and in-app chat. During peak times, responses can sometimes take longer.

Neither is perfect, but Paystack tends to be more consistent in response times.

## Integration Options

For platform integrations, both work with Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, and custom websites. Both also integrate with [Zynkart](https://zynkart.store), so whatever you choose, you can connect it to your store.

If you're building something custom and care about developer experience, both have solid documentation and well-designed APIs. Paystack's documentation is slightly cleaner, but Flutterwave's offerings are comprehensive.

## Recurring Payments

If your business involves subscriptions or payment plans, this matters.

Paystack has a polished subscription system with flexible billing cycles, a customer portal for managing subscriptions, and automatic retries when payments fail.

Flutterwave offers payment plans and custom billing schedules, driven primarily through their API. It works well but requires a bit more technical setup.

For straightforward subscription billing, Paystack's system is more turnkey.

## Thinking Beyond Nigeria

If you plan to expand across Africa, the picture changes significantly.

Paystack is available in Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, and Kenya. It supports NGN, USD, and GBP, with Stripe's infrastructure handling international payments.

Flutterwave operates in over 34 African countries and supports 150 or more currencies. For pan-African businesses, it's the more obvious choice.

## Which Should You Choose?

Go with Paystack if you're primarily selling in Nigeria, if fast settlement is important for your cash flow, if you prefer a simpler interface, if excellent documentation and support matter to you, or if you value the stability of Stripe's backing.

Go with Flutterwave if you're planning to sell across Africa, if you need the widest possible range of payment options, if slightly lower percentage fees make a difference at your volume, if you need USD collection accounts, or if you have complex payment requirements.

## Our Recommendation

For most Nigerian online stores just starting out, Paystack is the safer choice. Faster payouts help with cash flow. The simpler setup gets you selling quicker. Better support is there when you need it. And Stripe's backing provides stability and trust.

That said, Flutterwave is genuinely excellent if you're thinking bigger, especially for pan-African operations or if you specifically need payment methods that only Flutterwave offers.

Some businesses even use both gateways for redundancy. If one goes down, the other keeps working. With [Zynkart](https://zynkart.store), you can integrate both Paystack and Flutterwave, giving your customers maximum flexibility.
